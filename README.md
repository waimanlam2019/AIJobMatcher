# AI Job Matcher üöÄ

A full-stack Spring Boot + React web app that scrapes jobs from a job portal, uses an AI model to evaluate their relevance to your profile. Currently it could send an email to yourself letting you know which job is suitable for you.

# üß† What It Does

This project automates the job search process with a bit of intelligence:
- üîç Scrapes job listings from a job portal using Selenium WebDriver.
- üß© Matches jobs to your background using a local LLM model (Ollama).
- üß† Evaluates each job‚Äôs fit with a custom prompt and returns a verdict.
- ‚úÖ Stores job details and AI decisions in a PostgreSQL database.
- üåê Displays the results through a React frontend with filters and status flags.

# üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

## Backend ( Refactoring / Improvement in progress )
- **Spring Boot** (Java)
- **Selenium WebDriver** ‚Äì For scraping dynamic content
- **PostgreSQL** ‚Äì Persistent storage
- **Ollama** ‚Äì Local LLM for job relevance evaluation
- **REST API** ‚Äì For frontend integration

## Frontend ( https://github.com/waimanlam2019/simple-job-matching-ui )
- **React**
- Basic table UI with optional filters (e.g., Full-time / Part-time)
- In local environment, this app would expect an api on http://localhost:8080/api/matchingresults , which is provided by this java repo

## DevOps / Infra (Planned)
- Dockerizing backend
- React frontend served separately
- Kubernetes deployment (future goal)

# ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- AI-based matching verdicts (markdown formatted)
- Shortlist toggle using boolean flag
- Filtering by job type (Full-time / Part-time)
- Easy navigation and access to original job URLs

## ü§ñ AI Model Setup
This project uses Ollama to run a local LLM (like LLaMA2 or Mistral) that processes each job description.

Example prompt:

"Given the following job description and the candidate's profile, explain whether the job is suitable, and why."

üß™ Sample Verdict Output
‚úÖ This job is a strong fit. The candidate has 10+ years of Java backend experience and is currently studying AWS and React, which aligns with the job's cloud-native architecture...

üß† Future Improvements
Save shortlisted jobs

Deploy via Docker + Kubernetes

Switch to OpenAI API or HuggingFace for more accurate LLM evaluation

# PC Requirements for AI Job Matcher

## Minimum Recommended Setup
- **CPU:** Intel i5 10th Gen or equivalent
- **RAM:** 16 GB
- **GPU:** Mid-range GPU with at least 4 GB VRAM (for basic AI acceleration)
- **Storage:** SSD for faster read/write speeds
- **OS:** Linux preferred; Windows with WSL2 possible but with overhead

This setup is suitable for light scraping (e.g., 5 jobs max), running smaller AI models like `mistral`, and casual local development.

---

## Smooth Sailing Setup (For Serious Usage)
- **CPU:** 6-core / 12-thread or better (e.g. AMD Ryzen 7 5800X, Intel i7-12700)
- **RAM:** 32 GB (handles Docker, JVM, Chrome, and Ollama comfortably)
- **GPU:** NVIDIA RTX 3060 or better (8+ GB VRAM recommended for faster AI inference)
- **Storage:** NVMe SSD for fast I/O
- **OS:** Linux is preferred for performance and compatibility

Recommended if you plan to scrape dozens or hundreds of jobs, run larger AI models, or want smooth, responsive performance without freezing during processing.

---

## Notes
- Your older CPU (like Intel i5-6600) will work for basic testing but expect heavy CPU usage and possible freezes when running AI inference or multiple services concurrently.
- Using GPU acceleration via Ollama helps but only if your GPU meets or exceeds minimum VRAM requirements.
- Consider upgrading hardware or offloading heavy AI processing to a cloud or more powerful machine for large-scale jobs.

# üì¶ How to Run

## Software Requirement
- Nodejs for the Frontend
- Java/Intellij for the backend
- Ollama ( https://ollama.com/ ) with your desired AI Model such as LLaMa3:8B or mistral
- optional Docker Desktop ( https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/ )
- Maven ( https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi )
- Git ( https://git-scm.com/ )

## ‚öôÔ∏è Possible Configuration in `application-docker.properties`

Below are the essential configuration properties used to run the AI Job Matcher application in a Docker environment.

### üåê Web Scraper Configuration
- `app.initUrl` ‚Äì Initial URL to start scraping from (JobsDB listing).
- `app.maxJobs` ‚Äì Number of job postings to scrape in one batch.

### ü§ñ AI Model Configuration
- `app.aiModel` ‚Äì Name of the AI model used (e.g. `mistral`).
- `app.aiRoleplay` ‚Äì Prompt that defines the AI‚Äôs personality and behavior.
- `app.aiTask` ‚Äì Template prompt for generating the structured evaluation output.

### üë§ Candidate Profile
- `app.candidateProfile` ‚Äì A paragraph describing the candidate to be evaluated against job listings.

### ‚úâÔ∏è Email Notification
- `app.emailFrom` ‚Äì Gmail account used to send notifications.
- `app.emailPassword` ‚Äì App-specific Gmail password (not your real password).
- `app.emailTo` ‚Äì Recipient address for job matching results.
